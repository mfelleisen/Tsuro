# Tsuro
the Tsuro game for Sw Dev F'19


`env PLTSTDERR=info@drracket-background-compilation drracket`

get it into the wedged mode and then clear out the piles of
output you'll have and then ask it to expand a few times after that,
we should get some illuminating output. Hopefully. That is, the output
_after_ the blue thingy doesn't go away should show where the previous
blue thingy got stuck. I hope! Maybe the'll all be the same and maybe
they'll all point to somewhere helpful....
